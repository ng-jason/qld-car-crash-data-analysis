    "**Summary of datasets:**\r\n",
    "- Road crash locations: Location and characteristics of crashes within Queensland for all reported Road Traffic Crashes\r\n",
    "- Road casualties: Characteristics of casualties as a result of crashes within Queensland for all reported Road Traffic Crashes\r\n",
    "- Driver demographics: Driver involvement in crashes within Queensland for all reported Road Traffic Crashes\r\n",
    "- Seatbelt restraints and helmet use: Restraint use of vehicle occupant casualties, and helmet use of motorcycle riders/pillion casualties and bicycle rider/pillion casualties as a result of crashes within Queensland for all reported Road Traffic Crashes\r\n",

    "**Key takeaways**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "From 2001 to 2020:\r\n",
    "- The road with the most crashes was Bruce Highway with 12300 crashes followed by Pacific Highway with 5169 crashes.\r\n",
    "- The road with the most fatalities was also Bruce Highway with 719 total fatalities, followed by Warrego Highway with 120.\r\n",
    "- The day of the week with the most crashes was on Friday, and the day with the least was Sunday.\r\n",
    "    - On Friday, there is a 45.86% higher chance of being in a car crash than on Sunday\r\n",
    "- The time of day with the most crashes was 3pm, followed by 4pm, 5pm and 8 am. \r\n",
    "- The most common crash severity was medical treatment, followed by hospitalisation, minor injury and then fatality\r\n",
    "- Almost 45% of fatal crashes occurred on roads with a 100-110 km/h speed limit\r\n",
    "- Over 50% of crashes occur on roads with a 60 km/h speed limit \r\n",
    "- The age group that occurs most in crashes are 17-24 years of age followed by 30-39"
